# Art Evolve: Where AI Meets Abstract Art  
_Experience a creative fusion of **nature’s evolutionary logic** with the **boundless possibilities** of modern computing._

---

## ✨ Overview
**Art Evolve** is a playful yet powerful exploration of **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** applied to abstract art. By encoding each artwork as a “genome,” the program evolves its population of images over multiple generations, guided by user feedback. The result? A dazzling array of unpredictable shapes, colors, and forms—each generation surpassing the last in visual intrigue.

## 🎨 Key Highlights
- **Generative Wonder**  
  Each image is “grown” from simple parameters (size, color, shape types) into intricate, evolving designs.
- **User-Driven Evolution**  
  You become the critic and curator—rate artworks, and watch the system adapt to your aesthetic preferences.
- **Dynamic Color Palettes**  
  Vibrant hues are selected randomly and combined in surprising ways, guaranteeing ever-fresh visuals.
- **Modular Shapes**  
  Circles, rectangles, triangles, stars, spirals, and more—each with randomized positions, opacities, rotations, and sizes.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Random Genesis**  
   A population of abstract “genomes” (i.e., images) is generated with varying shapes and attributes.

2. **Interactive Rating**  
   As you rate each image, the system identifies which designs resonate most with your style.

3. **Breeding the Best**  
   Top-rated images reproduce through **crossover**, inheriting traits from parent designs and mixing them to form new, vibrant offspring.

4. **Mutation Magic**  
   Subtle random tweaks ensure the art stays diverse and avoids getting stuck in repetitive patterns.

5. **Iterative Refinement**  
   The process repeats for multiple generations, with each round presenting new aesthetic possibilities based on your input.

## 🌈 Why Art Evolve?
- **Infinite Inspiration**  
  Art Evolve harnesses nature-inspired algorithms to uncover combinations that might never occur to a human artist.
- **Engaging & Fun**  
  Be part of the creative cycle—your personal taste drives the outcome.
- **Customizable Complexity**  
  Tweak parameters like population size, mutation rate, or shape types to dial in the level of complexity you desire.
